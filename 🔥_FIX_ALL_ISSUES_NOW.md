## 🐛 If Still Having Issues

### Check 1: Database
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Should show:**
- categories
- products
- user_addresses
- orders
- order_items
- order_tracking

### Check 2: Backend
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/health
```

**Should return:**
```json
{"status":"ok","message":"Payment API Server Running",...}
```

### Check 3: Frontend
- App loads at http://localhost:3001/
- No console errors (F12)
- Can login/signup
- Can add to cart

### Check 4: User
- Logged in (see user icon)
- Cart has items (badge > 0)
- Form filled completely

## 🎯 Debug Order Creation

### If "Failed to create order" still appears:

1. **Open Console (F12)**
2. **Look for specific error:**
   - "relation public.orders does not exist" → Run Supabase SQL
   - "JWT expired" → Login again
   - "permission denied" → Run Supabase SQL
   - "null value in column user_id" → Make sure logged in

3. **Check Supabase:**
   - Go to Table Editor
   - Click on "orders" table
   - Should be accessible (even if empty)
