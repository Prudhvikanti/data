## 🛠️ For Production Payments

To enable real online payments (UPI, Card, etc), you need to set up a backend API.

### Why?
- Browsers block direct Cashfree API calls (CORS security)
- Secret keys must be kept on server, not browser
- This is normal and expected for all payment gateways

### Quick Options:

**Option 1: Supabase Edge Function (Easiest)**
- Create edge function in Supabase
- Deploy with one command
- See `LOCATION_AND_PAYMENT_FIXED.md` for code

**Option 2: Simple Express Server**
- Create basic Node.js backend
- Run on port 3002
- See `LOCATION_AND_PAYMENT_FIXED.md` for code

**Option 3: Serverless Function**
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- Use their serverless functions
- See documentation for setup

### Current Behavior (No Backend):
1. User selects online payment
2. App tries Cashfree API
3. CORS error (expected)
4. Automatically falls back to mock payment
5. Order still created successfully ✅
6. Shows warning: "Using test payment mode"

**This is perfectly fine for development and testing!** ✅
