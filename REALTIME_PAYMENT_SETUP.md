- ✅ Created startup script `start-payment-server.sh`

### 2. **Payment Service Enhancement**
- ✅ Updated `processPayment()` for real-time payments
- ✅ Added Cashfree SDK integration
- ✅ Added proper error handling with fallbacks
- ✅ Real payment processing with mock fallback

### 3. **Configuration Setup**

## 🚀 How to Enable Real-Time Payments

### Step 1: Start Backend Server

**Option A: Using the startup script**
```bash
./start-payment-server.sh
```

**Option B: Manual start**
```bash
node server.js
```

**You should see:**
```
🚀 Payment API Server Started!
📡 Server running on: http://localhost:3002
🏥 Health check: http://localhost:3002/health
💳 Payment API: http://localhost:3002/api/create-payment
```

### Step 2: Configure Cashfree Credentials

**Get your credentials from:**
1. Go to: https://merchant.cashfree.com/merchant/pg/onboarding/app
2. Sign up/Login to your account
3. Go to "Developers" → "API Keys"
4. Copy your App ID and Secret Key

**Update your `.env` file:**
```bash
VITE_CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_actual_app_id
VITE_CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret_key
VITE_CASHFREE_MODE=sandbox  # Change to 'production' for live payments
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### Step 3: Test Real-Time Payments

1. **Start your main app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test payment flow:**
   - Add products to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Select online payment method
   - Click "Place Order"
   - **✅ Real Cashfree payment page should open!**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Payment Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Pay Now"
2. Frontend calls backend API (/api/create-payment)
3. Backend creates Cashfree payment session
4. Frontend opens Cashfree checkout
5. User completes payment on Cashfree
6. Cashfree redirects back to app
7. Payment success/failure handled
```

### Backend API Endpoints:

**Create Payment:**
```
POST http://localhost:3002/api/create-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "orderData": {
    "amount": "299.99",
    "customerId": "CUST_123",
    "customerEmail": "user@example.com",
    "customerPhone": "9999999999",
    "customerName": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

**Verify Payment:**
```
POST http://localhost:3002/api/verify-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "orderId": "ORDER_123456"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Real-Time Payments

### Test 1: Backend Server Health
**Open:** http://localhost:3002/health
**Expected:** `{"status":"ok","message":"Payment API Server Running"}`

### Test 2: Payment Session Creation
**Open browser console and check:**
```javascript
✓ "Creating payment session via backend API..."
✓ "Backend response: {success: true, data: {...}}"
✓ "Payment session created successfully!"
```

### Test 3: Cashfree Integration
**When payment modal opens:**
```javascript
✓ "Processing real-time payment for order: ORDER_123"
✓ "Payment session created: {payment_session_id: '...'}"
✓ "Opening Cashfree checkout"
```

### Test 4: Complete Payment Flow
1. **Select payment method** → UPI/Card/Wallet
2. **Click "Pay Now"** → Cashfree page opens
3. **Complete payment** → Real payment processing
4. **Return to app** → Order confirmed

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Payment server not available"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Start backend server
node server.js
```

### Issue 2: "Cashfree credentials not configured"
**Solution:**
1. Update `.env` file with real credentials
2. Restart backend server
3. Check credentials in Cashfree dashboard

### Issue 3: "CORS error" or "Failed to fetch"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure backend server is running on port 3002
2. Check `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in environment
3. Verify server health: http://localhost:3002/health

### Issue 4: Payment page doesn't open
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Cashfree SDK is loaded
3. Check payment session creation
