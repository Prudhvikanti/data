## 🔐 Security Note

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Currently, the payment API calls are being made directly from the frontend with your secret key. This works but is **not recommended for production**.

### For Better Security (Recommended):

You should create a backend API endpoint that:
1. Takes order details from frontend
2. Calls Cashfree API from backend (keeping secret key secure)
3. Returns session ID to frontend
4. Frontend uses session ID to open Cashfree checkout

### Quick Backend Setup Options:

#### Option 1: Supabase Edge Function
Create a Supabase Edge Function to handle payment creation securely.

#### Option 2: Express.js Backend
```javascript
app.post('/api/create-payment', async (req, res) => {
  const { orderData } = req.body
  
  const response = await fetch('https://api.cashfree.com/pg/orders', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'x-client-id': process.env.CASHFREE_APP_ID,
      'x-client-secret': process.env.CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY,
      'x-api-version': '2023-08-01',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(orderData)
  })
  
  const data = await response.json()
  res.json(data)
})
```

#### Option 3: Serverless Function (Vercel/Netlify)
Deploy a serverless function to handle secure payment creation.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Working?

1. **Check Console:** Open browser DevTools → Console tab
2. **Look for errors:** Check for any error messages
3. **Verify credentials:** Make sure App ID and Secret Key are correct
4. **Check mode:** Ensure `VITE_CASHFREE_MODE=production`

### CORS Errors?

If you see CORS errors when calling Cashfree API:
- This means we need a backend API (see Security Note above)
- The browser blocks direct API calls with secret keys
- Quick fix: Use a proxy or backend service

### Payment Modal Not Opening?

1. Check if order was created successfully
2. Look for console errors
3. Verify Cashfree SDK loaded properly
4. Check network tab for failed requests
