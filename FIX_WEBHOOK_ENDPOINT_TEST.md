# 🔧 Fix Cashfree Webhook Endpoint Test Failure

## 🚨 **Issue:** "The endpoint did not respond properly to the test"

This error occurs when Cashfree can't properly test your webhook endpoint. Here's how to fix it:

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Enhanced Webhook Function**
- ✅ Added proper CORS headers
- ✅ Added HTTP method validation
- ✅ Added preflight request handling
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. **Improved Response Format**
- ✅ Proper status codes
- ✅ Consistent response structure
- ✅ Better error messages

## 🧪 **Test Your Webhook Endpoint:**

### **Step 1: Test the Endpoint Directly**
```bash
curl -X POST https://zsarfxdhcbjvgkhglbfkdvjcshagxfzdcgsxh.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/payment-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "order_id": "TEST_ORDER_123",
    "cf_order_id": "CF_ORDER_123",
    "payment_status": "SUCCESS",
    "payment_amount": "100.00",
    "payment_currency": "INR"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webhook processed successfully",
  "order_id": "TEST_ORDER_123",
  "payment_status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

### **Step 2: Check Netlify Function Logs**
1. **Go to:** Netlify dashboard → Functions tab
2. **Click:** `payment-webhook` function
3. **Check:** Recent logs for any errors
4. **Look for:** "Webhook processed successfully"

## 🔧 **Cashfree Dashboard Configuration:**

### **Step 1: Set Webhook URL**
```
https://zsarfxdhcbjvgkhglbfkdvjcshagxfzdcgsxh.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/payment-webhook
```

### **Step 2: Enable Webhook Events**
- ✅ Payment Success
- ✅ Payment Failure
- ✅ Payment Pending
- ✅ Refund Success
- ✅ Refund Failure

### **Step 3: Test Again**
1. **Click "Test" button** in Cashfree dashboard
2. **Wait for response** (should be successful now)
3. **If still failing, check Netlify logs**

## 🚀 **Deployment Status:**

- **✅ Code pushed to GitHub:** `3c78fbc`
- **✅ Netlify auto-deploying:** Wait 2-3 minutes
- **✅ Webhook function improved:** Better error handling

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Issue 1: Still Getting Test Failure**
**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to deploy
2. Test the endpoint manually with curl
3. Check Netlify function logs
4. Try the test again in Cashfree dashboard

### **Issue 2: Function Not Deployed**
**Solution:**
1. Check Netlify dashboard → Deploys tab
2. Look for latest deploy with commit `3c78fbc`
3. Check Functions tab for `payment-webhook`

### **Issue 3: CORS Errors**
**Solution:**
- CORS headers are now properly configured
- Function handles preflight requests
- Should work with Cashfree's test

## 📊 **Monitor Your Webhook:**

### **Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Go to Functions tab
2. Click `payment-webhook` function
3. Check logs for incoming webhooks
4. Monitor for any errors

### **Expected Logs:**
```
Payment webhook received: {...}
Headers: {...}
Processing webhook for order: ORDER_123
Payment status: SUCCESS
Webhook processed successfully for order: ORDER_123
```

## 🎯 **Result:**

**✅ Webhook endpoint properly configured**
**✅ CORS headers added**
**✅ HTTP method validation**
**✅ Cashfree test should pass**

Your webhook endpoint should now respond properly to Cashfree's test!

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Test the endpoint** manually with curl
3. **Try Cashfree test again**
4. **Enable webhook events** in Cashfree dashboard
5. **Test real payment flow**

The webhook endpoint is now properly configured and should pass Cashfree's test!
