## 🚀 How to Apply Updates

### Option 1: Fresh Setup
If you haven't set up Supabase yet:
1. Follow `QUICK_START.md`
2. Use the updated `database.sql`
3. You'll get everything automatically!

### Option 2: Update Existing Database
If you already have Supabase set up:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:

-- 1. Clear old data (order matters!)
DELETE FROM order_items;
DELETE FROM orders;
DELETE FROM products;
DELETE FROM categories;

-- 2. Copy and run the complete database.sql file
-- This will create all new products with details
```

### Option 3: Keep Old Products, Add New Ones

- Or cherry-pick products from `database.sql`
