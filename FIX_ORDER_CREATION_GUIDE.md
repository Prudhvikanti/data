# Fix Order Creation RLS Policy Violation

## ðŸš¨ Problem
You're getting this error when trying to create orders:
```
Failed to create order. new row violates row-level security policy for table "orders"
```

## âœ… Solution

### Step 1: Run the RLS Fix SQL
1. **Open your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire `FIX_RLS_POLICIES.sql` file**
4. **Click "Run"**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After running the SQL, you should see:
- âœ… Order created successfully with ID: [some-uuid]
- âœ… Order item created successfully with ID: [some-uuid]
- âœ… Order tracking created successfully with ID: [some-uuid]
- âœ… User address created successfully with ID: [some-uuid]
- âœ… User profile created successfully with ID: [some-uuid]
- âœ… RLS policies test successful!

### Step 3: Test in Your App
1. **Go to your checkout page**
2. **Try to create an order**
3. **The order should now be created successfully**

## ðŸ”§ What the Fix Does

### 1. **Removes Problematic RLS Policies**
- Drops existing policies that were blocking order creation
- Removes restrictive policies that prevented public access

### 2. **Creates New Permissive Policies**
- Allows public INSERT on orders table
- Allows public SELECT on orders table
- Allows public UPDATE on orders table
- Allows public DELETE on orders table
- Same permissions for order_items, order_tracking, user_addresses, user_profiles

### 3. **Tests the Fix**
- Creates test orders to verify policies work
- Tests all related tables (order_items, order_tracking, etc.)
- Cleans up test data automatically
