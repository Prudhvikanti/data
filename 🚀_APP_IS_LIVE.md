## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

### Current Setup:
The app is currently calling Cashfree API directly from the frontend. This works for testing but exposes your secret key in the browser.

### For Production Deployment:
You should set up a backend API to:
1. Keep secret keys secure on the server
2. Create payment sessions from backend
3. Verify payments on server-side
4. Handle webhooks securely

### Backend Options:
- **Option 1:** Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended)
- **Option 2:** Express.js API Server
- **Option 3:** Serverless Functions (Vercel/Netlify)
